# SmartHomeATmega32
This project is a smart home project that uses an ATmega32 microcontroller to control the lights, door, fan, and RGB LED in a home. The microcontroller is connected to a variety of sensors and actuators, including:

* A light sensor to detect the ambient light level and adjust the brightness of the lights accordingly.
* A door sensor to detect whether the door is open or closed.
* A servo motor to control the door.
* A DC motor to control the fan.
* An RGB LED to create custom light colors.
* A keypad to enter the door password.
* An LCD display to show the system state, such as the current light level and the door status.

## Features

* Automatic light adjust control: The lights will automatically adjust their brightness according to the ambient light level. This helps to save energy.
* Door password: The door can be locked and unlocked with a password. This helps to prevent unauthorized access.
* LCD display: The system state is displayed on an LCD display. This allows you to see the current light level, the door status, and other information.
* Keypad: The door password can be entered using a keypad. This makes it easy to enter the password without having to remember it.
